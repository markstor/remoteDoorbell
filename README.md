# remoteDoorbell
Files used to control remotely a doorbell.
The doorbell used to develop this is the Monitor Compact Digital from the spanish manufacturer Auta.
A 2-way audio and analog video are available to integrate in Home Assistant.
Everything relies on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2W, with an external module to convert the analog video to an UVC connected in the OTG USB port.
